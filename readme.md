# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal is to practice HTML, CSS and JS skills by building a 'Etch A Sketch'-like (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) website. 

Furthermore, this project allows to test one's understanding of 'DOM' manipulation.

# Features

* Etch A Sketch: Just hover your mouse over the cases to play! 
* Resetting: Want to start another drawing? Click the 'reset' button to have a new empty board.
* Custome grid size: Click 'Make a new grid' to set your own grid size. 
* Put colours in your life: Fill the sketch with random colours.

# Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

# Requirements

- Build by default a 16*16 grid using Javascript and flexboxes


- Use javascript events and css to change the color of the cases when the user hovers over them 
- Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
- Prevent the user from entering incorrect input

# Lessons learnt 

This project reinforced: 

- Javascript coding abilities (event creation, loops)
- DOM: manipulation of CSS and HTML through javascript
